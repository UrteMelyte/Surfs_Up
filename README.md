# Surfs Up

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The client has asked us to analyze two specific months of Hawaii temperature data to determine weather their business would be profitable year round.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
- Overall, the average temp in June and December is pretty similar, differing by only 4.9 degrees (74.9 - 71.0).
- The largest difference is in the minimum temperature, which was 64 in June and 56 in December.
- The quartiles for June temps were all in the 70s, while December's dropped down to 69 degrees.

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
- While temperatures do dip in December, it seems like the weather year round would be favorable for a surf & ice cream shop. The temps still reach the mid 70s, and with the sun shining that's high enough for ice cream to sound enticing. 
- An additional query could be reviewing station or lat/lon data, as some parts of the island might have different weather patterns.
- As rainy days are likely less busy both in terms of ice cream sales and surfing, we should also review pricipitation for these months to ensure December is still viable.
